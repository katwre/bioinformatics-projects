Bioinformatic Notes
==================

Here are my bioinformatic mini-projects and implementations of some common algorithms that I wrote during my Bsc and Msc studies (2012-2014), including:

| Project | Folder | Link |
|------------|------|------|
| 1. Replica exchange Monte Carlo algorithms for protein folding | Molecular_Dynamics | [🔗 Link](https://github.com/katwre/bioinformatics-projects/tree/master/Molecular_Dynamics) |
| 2. Regulatory region discovery using overrepresented motifs with binomial distribution and Ensembl public MySQL Servers | bio_motif_ensembl | [🔗 Link](https://github.com/katwre/bioinformatics-projects/tree/master/bio_motif_ensembl) |
| 3. Genome assembly using de Bruijn Graph implementation with Eulerian walk-finder | genome_assembly | [🔗 Link](https://github.com/katwre/bioinformatics-projects/tree/master/genome_assembly) |
| 4. Implementation of the Felsenstein's tree-pruning and the Nearest-Neighbor Interchange (NNI) algorithms | comparative_genomics | [🔗 Link](https://github.com/katwre/bioinformatics-projects/tree/master/comparative_genomics) | 
| 5. A Galaxy workflow that automates mRNA annotation and contamination filtering using BLAST | mRNA_Markup | [🔗 Link](https://github.com/katwre/bioinformatics-projects/tree/master/mRNA_Markup)
