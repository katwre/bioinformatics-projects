Bioinformatic Notes
==================

Here are my bioinformatic mini-projects and implementations of some common algorithms that I wrote during my Bsc and Msc studies (2012-2014), including:

1. Implementation of simulated annealing and replica exchange Monte Carlo algorithms for protein folding in the HP model (Molecular_Dynamics)
2. Potential regulatory region discovery algorithm based on the binomial distribution of overrepresented motifs that uses the Ensembl public MySQL Servers (bio_motif_ensembl)
3. Impementation of the Felsenstein's tree-pruning and the Nearest-Neighbor Interchange (NNI) algorithms (comparative_genomics)
4. Code for merging two files in CIF format for a crystallography project (crystallography)
5. De Bruijn Graph implementation with Eulerian walk-finder (genome_assembly)
